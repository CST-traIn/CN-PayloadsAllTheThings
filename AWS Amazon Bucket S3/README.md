Bucket Finder
A cool tool that will search for readable buckets and list all the files in them. It can also be used to quickly find buckets that exist but deny access to listing files.
```
wget https://digi.ninja/files/bucket_finder_1.1.tar.bz2 -O bucket_finder_1.1.tar.bz2
./bucket_finder.rb my_words
./bucket_finder.rb --region ie my_words
	US Standard         = http://s3.amazonaws.com
	Ireland             = http://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com
	Northern California = http://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com
	Singapore           = http://s3-ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com
	Tokyo               = http://s3-ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com

./bucket_finder.rb --download --region ie my_words
./bucket_finder.rb --log-file bucket.out my_words
```
Use a custom wordlist for the bucket finder, can be created with
```
List of Fortune1000 company names with permutations on .com, -backup, -media. For example, walmart becomes walmart, walmart.com, walmart-backup, walmart-media.
List of the top Alexa 100,000 sites with permutations on the TLD and www. For example, walmart.com becomes www.walmart.com, www.walmart.net, walmart.com, and walmart.
